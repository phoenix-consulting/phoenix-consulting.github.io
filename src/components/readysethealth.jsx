            <h2>Ready, Set, Health!</h2>
            <p> On May 4, 2021, we hosted Ready, Set, Health!, a demo day for early-stage healthcare startups. We held a series of virtual pitches and networking sessions for 20+ cutting-edge startups and 30+ excited investors. The event was sponsored by SOMPO Digital Labs, who provided a $25,000 prize of non-dilutive funding out to the winning pitch. The winner of our pitch competition was Rubitection, a company which impressed our judges with its innovative skin monitoring product. </p>
